Let's use React on the front-end too!

From this exercise on, we'll use React not only on the server side but also on the front-end. Let's raise the event on the front-end, and see what will happen. In the past exercises, there was some code that raised a front-end event, but it did not work. Where is that?

The code is the check of the checkbox event you wrote in State. At State, to tell the truth, you can check the checkbox no matter what code you write. In this exercise, let's confirm if you can write the right code or not. There is a lot of code to change ! Let's try it!

Question
Start by installing the required modules. Run the four commands below.

$ npm install browserify babelify babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015
Next, let's create app.js at the same directory as program.js and copy the code below into the file.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import TodoBox from './views/index.jsx';

let data = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('initial-data').getAttribute('data-json'));
ReactDOM.render(<TodoBox data={data} />, document.getElementById("app"));
The above code is to use React at front-end. This code passes TodoBox from index.jsx, and data from server that are passed in the id of initial-data to the element that has the id of app.

Next, let's fix program.js. You can also make a new program.js file and write all the code there.

First of all, let's add these require statements - like this:

var React = require('react');
var ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');
var DOM = React.DOM;
var body = DOM.body;
var div = DOM.div;
var script = DOM.script;

var browserify = require('browserify');
var babelify = require("babelify");
Next, add a line that reads index.jsx under the sentence that require s babel/register.

require('babel/register')({
    ignore: false
});

var TodoBox = require('./views/index.jsx');
Finally, fix the router of /bundle.js and / like below. If you have an access to /bundle.js, you change app.js that can work on the front-end and response. If you have an access to /, you response HTML that consists of reading index.jsx, and data from server, and bundle.js.

app.use('/bundle.js', function (req, res) {
    res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/javascript');

    browserify({ debug: true })
        .transform(babelify.configure({
            presets: ["react", "es2015"],
            compact: false
        }))
        .require("./app.js", { entry: true })
        .bundle()
        .pipe(res);
});

app.use('/', function (req, res) {
    var initialData = JSON.stringify(data);
    var markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(React.createElement(TodoBox, {data: data}));

    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');

    var html = ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(body(null,
        div({id: 'app', dangerouslySetInnerHTML: {__html: markup}}),
        script({
            id: 'initial-data',
            type: 'text/plain',
            'data-json': initialData
        }),
        script({src: '/bundle.js'})
    ));

    res.end(html);
});
After writing the necessary code, run node program.js 3000 Milk 13:00 and access http://localhost:3000 , and check the real HTML that is outputted.

Click the checkbox some times, and confirm whether you can check the checkbox correctly.

After that, run learnyoureact verify program.js.

NOTE: I think some of you might notice the difference of HTML in which by running verify and accessing http://localhost:3000. data-react-checksum or data-reactid that keep the DOM unique make the compare of right answer and the code you write fail in the quality. So if you run verify, this code compares the code at other part of HTML.

If you have time, confirm that the checkbox does not work when you set true or false in setState in handleChange.
